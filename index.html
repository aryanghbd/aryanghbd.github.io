        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Hello! I'm Aryan Ghobadi, and you've just reached my personal website! This website was made as a means to introduce myself, what I do and what I'm going to be doing. For background information, I am a 3rd Year MEng Student of Electronics and
            Information Engineering (EIE) at Imperial College London. In my eyes, I study the perfect degree, as it allows me to tread through the realms of both hardware and software, high-level and low-level, front-end to back-end while threading the
            hardware-software interface, enabling me to have a deep and enriching understanding of system functionality from multiple perspectives. I have an interest in both software engineering, embedded software engineering and hardware engineering,
            from high-level work, machine-learning to API development, app development and compiler and CPU engineering.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">
            Through my degree projects combined with my own learning outside of the classroom, along with various side projects that I am working on, I am always looking to develop my engineering and programming skills and apply them into new environments, in order
            to solve a variety of different dynamic problems. If you would like to know more or if you would like to have chat, don't hesitate to send a message in the 'Contact Me' section, or drop me a message on any of the links above!

        <h4>C to MIPS Compiler:</h4>
        <p4>As part of a pair, implemented and developed a compiler system converting ANSI C programs into their MIPS Assembly equivalents. Compiler able to handle advanced C structures, including embedded statements, classes and structs, recursive functions
            and pointers. Developed the Compiler in a modularised format, producing and linking lexers, parsers, intermediate converters, and code generators together into one streamlined system.</p4>
