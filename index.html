        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Hello! I'm Aryan Ghobadi, and you've just reached my personal website! This website was made as a means to introduce myself, what I do and what I'm going to be doing. For background information, I am a 3rd Year MEng Student of Electronics and
            Information Engineering (EIE) at Imperial College London. In my eyes, I study the perfect degree, as it allows me to tread through the realms of both hardware and software, high-level and low-level, front-end to back-end while threading the
            hardware-software interface, enabling me to have a deep and enriching understanding of system functionality from multiple perspectives. I have an interest in both software engineering, embedded software engineering and hardware engineering,
            from high-level work, machine-learning to API development, app development and compiler and CPU engineering.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">
            Through my degree projects combined with my own learning outside of the classroom, along with various side projects that I am working on, I am always looking to develop my engineering and programming skills and apply them into new environments, in order
            to solve a variety of different dynamic problems. If you would like to know more or if you would like to have chat, don't hesitate to send a message in the 'Contact Me' section, or drop me a message on any of the links above!

        <h4>C to MIPS Compiler (2021):</h4>
        <h4>Technologies used: C, C++, Yacc, Bison</h4>
        <p4>As part of a pair, implemented and developed a compiler system converting ANSI C programs into their MIPS Assembly equivalents. Compiler able to handle advanced C structures, including embedded statements, classes and structs, recursive functions
            and pointers. Developed the Compiler in a modularised format, producing and linking lexers, parsers, intermediate converters, and code generators together into one streamlined system.</p4>

        <h4>IoT Controlled Mars Rover</h4>
        <h4>Technologies used: Arduino, C++, C, Verilog, Python, React.js, mongo.DB, Computer Vision, FPGA</h4>
        <p4>Developed a controllable Rover as part of a team. Capable of responding to commands issued from a self-designed webserver utilising the MQTT protocol. Computer vision algorithm developed onboard an FPGA used in order to detect colours and distances
            to objects and obstacles (Euclidean). Equipped with a developed Control system for the Rover on a ESP32 microcontroller using Arduino, capable of connecting to an MQTT client, receiving, validating, and acting upon commands, using UART to
            both communicate with the driving subsystem, and extract coordinate and angle information, as well as FPGA vision data to send back to a central command terminal. Uses an optimized algorithm for autonomous motion that allows the rover to move
            by itself to a given point or perform autopilot duties with no user-intervention.</p4>

        <h4>MIPS Processor Design</h4>
        <h4>Technologies used: Verilog, Icarus, C, C++, Python, low-level design, unit-testing</h4>
        <p4>Collaborated and co-developed on a Verilog based CPU implementing the MIPS architecture, with a lightweight design in mind in order to minimise resource usage in area-critical operations. Developed from the ground up providing the user with the
            choice of either a Harvard or an Avalon based memory bus interface implementation, giving tailored extensibility, connectivity, compactness and low latency. Control and Data Paths of the CPU implemented with robust test benches and instruction
            testing in mind, with an in-house C based MIPS assembler in order to ensure a functional and efficient deliverable. Memory and caching fully developed.</p4>
